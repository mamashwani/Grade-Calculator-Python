# Grade-Calculator-Python
Executing together “if” and “elif” statements to determine the letter grade corresponding to a user-input final average. 


# Objectives:
- Your program should ask the user for a final average, as a floating point number.
- It should use that number to determine the corresponding letter grade and print out the letter grade in a short message, using a standard grading guide.
- Your program should employ a function to handle the letter grade determination and return the letter grade, but not actually print within the function.
- Write a function that will determine the number of points (float) necessary to earn the next higher grade and print a message showing this number.
